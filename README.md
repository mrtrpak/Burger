# Burger

## Synopsis
This application is designed to be able to utilize a database, update the database based on user input and update the database. This was used to better my skills with using heroku, mysql and bringing it all together to bring a working app. 

## Getting Started
On load of the website it will show the burgers in the database on the left. There is also an option to add in more burgers. After entering a new burger that new burger is automatically added to the bottom of the list with a button generated next to it.
